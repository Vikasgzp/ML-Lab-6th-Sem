# 1. Which department has the most consistent scores?

# Consistency means lowest standard deviation (std) of Total_Score.

# From the table:

# CE: std = 19.18

# CS: std = 11.27

# EC: std = 10.73

# ME: std = 12.20

# Answer:
# EC department has the most consistent scores (lowest std of 10.73).

# 2. Do A or B batches perform better?

# Compare average Total_Score of batches A and B:

# Batch A: 80.43

# Batch B: 87.60

# Answer:
# Batch B performs better on average.

# 3. What could explain the difference?

# Looking at Project_Marks averages:

# Batch A: 22.85

# Batch B: 24.25

# Batch B has higher average project marks, which likely contributes to its better total scores.

# Other factors might include differences in attendance or student composition, but here higher project marks in Batch B seem to explain the performance difference.

# Summary:

# Most consistent department: EC

# Better batch: B

# Reason: Batch B has higher average project marks, which likely improves overall performance.
