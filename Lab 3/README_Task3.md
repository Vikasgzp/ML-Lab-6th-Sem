# 📈 Task 3: Statistical Analysis & Interpretation

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze department and batch-level performance statistics.

---

## 📊 Department Statistics

Computed:

- Mean Total Score
- Standard Deviation (Consistency)
- Median Attendance
- Total Hackathons

### 📌 Key Insight

- Department with lowest standard deviation is most consistent.
- Department with lowest average or highest weak students needs attention.

---

## 🏫 Batch Analysis

Grouped lab batches into:

- A (A1–A4)
- B (B1–B4)

Compared:

- Mean Total Score
- Mean Project Marks

---

## 🧠 Interpretation Questions

1. Most consistent department → Lowest std deviation
2. Better performing batch → Higher mean score
3. Possible reasons:
   - Attendance differences
   - Hackathon participation
   - CS score multiplier
   - Random variation

---

## 📘 Concepts Used

- GroupBy aggregation
- Multi-level columns
- Statistical interpretation
